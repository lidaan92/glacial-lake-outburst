# Lake Outburst Simulations

This repository contains the setup to run simplified simulations using the 
shallow water equations in the context of glacial lake outburst.  In particular
the lakes being considered are in the Himalayas:

1. Imja (86.928 E, 27.898 N)
1. Lower Braun
1. Thulagi Lake (84.485513 E, 28.488053 N)
